## SuperPaymaster

SuperPaymaster is a project supporting gas sponsorship with cross-chain, multi-protocol, multi-type accounts, and more features, including smart contracts, relay, dashboard with control rules and one-key deployed docker images.

The unique SuperPaymaster strengths for Ethereum are:

1. System improvements in gas sponsor UX(NFT, ENS), Cost(Gas Tank), and Security(Alert).
2. Weak censorship for transaction gas sponsorship(Sponsor any transaction with one-key deployment without native token requirements).
3. Diversity in the ERC20 gas sponsor market(Projects can support their ERC20 with gas sponsorship).
4. Lower dev cost to gas sponsor ability for DApps(SDK and ENS contract).
